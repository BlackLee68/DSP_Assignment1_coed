# DSP_Assignment1_coed
 In the DSP_Assignment1_code, the ass1_main.m, signal.mat and fir_type2_hp_cvx.m is the original code
 provided by the professor, the rest code written by me  is the coed corresponding to the questions.
 
 And also, when you run the code written by me to show the result, please be sure to run the ass1_main.m 
 and fir_type2_hp_cvx.m firstly to load the signal data. Thank you!
